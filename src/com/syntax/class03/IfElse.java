	// why should i learn casting?
	//so that we can use the code that is written by someone else to make our life easier
	//or when we will be working in teams we will be able to merge the code
	//what is the syntax of type casting?
	//when we are converting something smaller to a larger we dont need to do anything
	//it happen automatically we just assign the variable
	
    // int box=1234;
		
	//long box2=box; // this is how it works and it is called implicit or widening automatically
	//however when we convert a larger data type to a smaller data type
